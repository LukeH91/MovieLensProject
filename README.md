Capstone Project 1 for HarvardX PH125.9x Data Science - a MovieLens Recommendation System in R

This is one of two pieces of coursework from the end of the HarvardX PH125.9x Data Science for learning data analysis in R. 
It includes an R script which downloads the necessary code and performs all the visualisations/analyses, an RMD file which 
knits into a PDF formally explaining all the steps of the project, and the completed PDF for convenience.
